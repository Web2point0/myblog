Another brief post to keep you updated on privacy and spam when it comes to email.

There are services out there that offer email aliases where no account needed and with which you're provided with a disposable-
email address. This is not that type of tutorial.

The reason I like this provided service from <a href="https://DuckDuckGo.com">Duckduckgo.com</a>. While most services like
etc) I-cloud, ProtonMail; are charging you a fee for this service. Duckduckgo provides it to you for free.

All you have to do is either download the app on your mobile phone or visit the <a href="https://DuckDuckGo.com">Duckduckgo.com</a>
search engine in your favorite internet browser and find that install button for their browser. Thats right! It isn't just a 
search engine anymore.

Find the settings section within the app or on the computer and locate "Email Protection". Once on the page where you get to 
choose your very own "@duck" address and your satisfied with your decision you'll receive a confirmation password sent to your
personal email address. Copy the received message and paste onto the page for verification and presto!

You'll be able to create aliases on this page or within the tabs bar just be on the look out for "Email Protection".
Create the aliases for each intended purpose for that service or website. That way it's easy to isolate 
and know which section is giving you spam, and from there you can deactivate that email alias and no need to filter 
through your email feed.

Email aliases not only help you stop spam but also serve a sheild in the defense line when it comes to data breaches. 
I just think it's a great invention and tool to have under your belt in this digital world.
