This post will just be a brief writing on getting free hosting and a cheap domain registrar. There are platforms that offer subdomains like github which offer another free hosting alternative but we'll discuss that in another post. 

The free website hosting service we'll be using is called <a href="https://www.infinityfree.com">infinityfree.com</a>. They do offer subdomains which you'll be able to use if you do not have a domain.
I wish I found this site as a kid because who doesn't love free hosting! :D

Infinityfree does offer cheap domain names through their other service provider called <a href="https://ifastnet.com">ifastnet.com</a>.
Now, with your favorite domain name registar ready go and link the nameservers with the ones with your hosting provider.

Other cheap domain name providers I've found are: <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> and <a href="https://domains.cloudflare.com">domains.cloudflare.com</a>.

Infinityfree offers an abundance of features like your very own cpanel and software like wordpress to quickly get your website up and running.
