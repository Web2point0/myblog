This website is being served to you locally on a raspberry pi sitting on my desk in sunny Florida. :D
Below is just describing the basic theme i'm using and that it's built with jekyll. I plan on making more of it my own. For now you get a scroll I made when I was 13. Just in case the person who is reading this doesn't know; Jekyll is a static website aggregator. If you didn't read my blog post on my homepage well; there's no backend. I have no servers and I don't to expose my entire computer to the world by opening ports on my router. I simply use cloudflare which exposes my port 4000 to the world and this is the website you see:) The purpose of this website is just to act as my personal sandbox on the internet. I tinker with a lot of things locally and here is where I test them publicly.
